Very Important!
1. credentials
    here, I use mine credentials, this may not work for others or others need to login in my account
    please replace this to yours if error occurs
2. path
    here, the storing path is "os.getcwd() + "/Folder/"", where the Folder is generated
3. rename
    for downloading and uploading path, please carefully check the comments
4. rename 2
    for storing folder, please replace every "/Folder/" to the name you desire
    or change it into other variables
5. test
    I strongly recommend to test the upload and download separately 
    for uploading, I have created example folders in this zip, it works perfect
    please create files like that if possible
